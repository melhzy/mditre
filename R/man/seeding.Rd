\description{
Deterministic seed generation using the seedhash library.
This ensures reproducibility across different runs and experiments.

The seeding process works as follows:
\enumerate{
\item A seed_string (e.g., MDITRE master seed + experiment name) is hashed using MD5
\item The MD5 hash is converted to a seed_number (master_seed) - a deterministic integer
\item This master_seed is used to generate additional repeatable random seeds
\item Seeds can be used to initialize random number generators (R base, torch)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(mditre)

# Create generator with default MDITRE master seed
seed_gen <- mditre_seed_generator()

# Get the master_seed (first seed from hash)
master_seed <- seed_gen$generate_seeds(1)[1]
print(paste("Master seed:", master_seed))

# Use master_seed to set all RNGs
set_mditre_seeds(master_seed)

# Or generate multiple seeds for different components
seeds <- seed_gen$generate_seeds(5)
# seeds[1] for data splitting, seeds[2] for model init, etc.

# Create generator with custom experiment name
seed_gen_exp <- mditre_seed_generator(experiment_name = "experiment_v1")
exp_seeds <- seed_gen_exp$generate_seeds(3)

# Get the hash for reproducibility tracking
print(seed_gen_exp$get_hash())
}
}
