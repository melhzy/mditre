\title{Soft AND Operation}
\usage{
soft_and(x, dim = -1L, epsilon = 1e-10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input tensor with values in \link{0, 1}}

\item{dim}{Integer; dimension along which to compute AND (default: -1)}

\item{epsilon}{Small constant for numerical stability}
}
\value{
Tensor with soft AND values
}
\description{
Differentiable AND operation using product. Approximates logical AND
for continuous values in \link{0, 1}.
}
\details{
For binary inputs, product approximates AND. For continuous inputs,
it acts as a "soft" AND where the output is high only if all inputs are high.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(torch)
# Multiple conditions
x <- torch_tensor(rbind(c(0.9, 0.8, 0.95), c(0.1, 0.9, 0.8)))
result <- soft_and(x, dim = 2L)  # AND across columns
}
