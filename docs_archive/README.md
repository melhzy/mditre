# Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical documentation files created during the MDITRE v2.0 modular refactoring process. These documents have been consolidated into the main `README.md` for better user experience.

## Archived Documents

- **CHECKLIST.md**: Implementation checklist tracking all completed work
- **DATA_LOADER_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide to the data loader system
- **IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md**: Summary of the complete implementation
- **MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Detailed architecture documentation
- **PACKAGE_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md**: Validation report and test results
- **REFACTORING_PLAN.md**: Original refactoring plan
- **REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md**: Summary of refactoring work

## Current Documentation

For current documentation, please see:

- **Main README**: `../README.md` - Comprehensive user guide
- **Data Loader Specific**: `../mditre/data_loader/README.md` - Data loading API reference
- **Examples**: `../mditre/examples/` - Working code examples
- **Tutorials**: `../mditre/tutorials/` - Jupyter notebook tutorials

## Purpose

These documents are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Development tracking
- Understanding design decisions
- Future maintenance

They are no longer required for day-to-day usage of MDITRE, as all essential information has been integrated into the main README.md in a more user-friendly format.
